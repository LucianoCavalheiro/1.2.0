### Submitting Bug Reports

If you find a problem with MailWatch, whether you are stuck or want to address it yourself, first log it using the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/mailwatch/1.2.0/issues).

### Contributing to MailWatch

#### Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* [Submit an issue](https://github.com/mailwatch/1.2.0/issues) for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
   * Clearly describe the issue and your enviroment including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
   * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* If you want to contribute new code or fix existing one fork the repository on GitHub or do a hard reset (first [add upstream to your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and then issue a `git fetch upstream && git checkout develop && git reset --hard upstream/develop && git push` command) to update an existing fork.

#### Branching and pull requests
As a guideline, please follow this process:

 1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
 2. Create a topic branch for the change:
    * Please ensure the branch is clearly labelled as a feature or fix.
    * Avoid working directly on the **master** branch.
 3. Make the relevant changes.
 4. [Squash](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) commits if necessary.
 5. It should go without saying, but do not increment the version number in your commits.
 6. [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to the **develop** branch.

Please note this is a general guideline only.
